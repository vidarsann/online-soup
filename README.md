# Online soup

This is a school project with focus on UX design. We worked together in a group to produce a Uber Eats-like soup delivery service prototype but programmed the app individually. 
The app is purely front end built with react (bootstrapped with create-react-app) with mock data. It uses hooks heavily to maintain state throughout the app. Besides react I used react-leaflet to implement a real-time, 
functioning map and logs your location. 

This app was designed mobile first and as such has a cleaner design when viewed in mobile view, but is ofcourse responsive and works with all screens.

## Key libraries

#### React (with *react-alice-carousel, react-leaflet, react-router, react-switch* and *react-select*.

1. react-alice-carousel
1. react-leaflet
1. react-router
1. react-switch
1. react-select

#### SASS

SASS was used to make writing CSS easier and cleaner. As this was a relatively design-heavy project this was a very welcome library. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
